is formed from three MS. copies, of which no single one is perfect, and no ’

othelr lif. known to exist. The knowledge of two of these is due to Mr. 1-1.
Bra s aw.

Ι. He Lincoln MS. is one of the treasures in the library belonging to
the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln.

The volume consists of two MSS. bound together.

ΤΙιε first part, beautifully written by John Wodeburgh, contains :—

(i.) Legenda de vita sci Ricardi de Hampole, similiter cum ἔ
[cetero] proprio officio.

(ii.) Item libellus ejusdem sci Ricardi de amore Dei contra amatores

(iii.) Itexrriiulligzllus seu tractatus ejusdem super lectiones defunctorum.

(iiii.) Item tractatus eJusdem super Psalmum Dfie in virtute tua
- letabitur rex.

This volume has lost one or perhaps two entire leaves, and the lower
portion of another leaf : both of these lacunoe are in No. 1., which is this
Office of Richard the hermit. Otherwise John Wodeburgh's volume was
perfect and legible until a few years ag0, when, in an attempt to transcribe
a portion of it for the E. E. T. S. (No, 20), the first leaf entirely, and words
in other places, were blackened by misuse of chemicals.

The portion of Hampole’s Office containing the Vespers is taken from
that very imperfect copy—compared as far as possible with the MS„ and
corrected and gaps supplied from the Cotton MS. This MS. is referred
to as L.

The second part, or full half of the present volume of the Lincoln MS.
contains Richard’s treatise ‘ Melos Amoris? A leaf is wanting at the

beginning. The MS. is written in a very different hand, it is in double
columns„ and extends to rro leaves

II. The MS. in the Bodleian Library (e Mus. ¹93) has this Office
bound up with other matter. It has lost its first leaveS, which probably
contained the Vespers3 as the present fol. 1 commences with the first
Psalm of completorium. The Psalms are written at full length in all the
Offices ι and the Antiphons are written as they were to be said or sung—
ἐι, the opening words before the Psalm, and the whole Antiphon after the
Psalm.

This MS. does not contain the long addition to Lect. viii„ and it has
not the ferial Antiphons and Responsories at the end of the ferial Lections;
but it has the Service of Compline at full length, which is not mentioned in
the Lincoln MS. This is referred to as B.

ΙΙΙ. The MS. in the British Museum (Cotton. Tiberius A. xv.) is in
one of the scorched volumes. This office is in the latter part of the
volume. It supplies words or portions where the Lincoln MS. is spoiled.
