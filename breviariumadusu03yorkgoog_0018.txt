It has the long Lection (in L., and in this transcript, written as continuation

supposition that it was intended to be read as a Lario ad Primam in

capitulo. This MS. is referred to as C.

The Indexes will explain themselves, We believe that such
an attempt has never before been made3 but of its value we are
thoroughly convinced. By the comparison between different
Breviaries which such long lists facilitate, we may in time get to
some clearer knowledge of the families of these service-books,
And if in even the smallest degree we have contributed to such an
object, our drudgery will not have been in’ vain. The Index of
Versicles contains such as are said aster each Nocturn, the Ver-siculi
SacerdotiS, those said after the Hymns‚ and those used in the
Memorie. Sometimes a Vei-sicle which is not in this Index will be
referred to by catchwordS. Under such circumstances it will be
found either among the Anthems or ResponsorieS. Sometimes

also an Anthem or Responsory is used as a Capitulum.
